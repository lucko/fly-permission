# fly-permission
Simple plugin to require a permission for players to use fly mode.

Will need to be used alongside another plugin that grants fly status to players. (e.g. Essentials)

At least in Essentials, players can still fly even if they don't have the essentials.fly permission. If you want to grant access to /fly temporarily, you need a plugin (like this one) to ensure fly is disabled when the player loses the permission.
